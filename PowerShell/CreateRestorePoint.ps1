I pulled out the last created checkpoint (variable $lastChkptime) in order to compare in if 24 hours (1440 minutes) passed since last checkpoint was created since using the script it's not possible to create more than 1 within 24 hours (this option is available when creating restore points in GUI).  If 24 hours passed or the variable $lastChkptime is null the function CreateMyRestorePoint is called. A new checkpoint gets created and then the script checks if there are 2 or more existing checkpoints (for example created manually or by the system like Windows updates etc.) and if yes, then the oldest checkpoint is deleted.
In $lastChkptime, I had to select only last checkpoint time since if the result was 2 or more checkpoints, $lastChkptime variable would be an array and then conversion '($lastChkptime.Date).ToString("yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss")' would fail.
Creation time is returned as string in format yyyymmddHHMMSS.mmmmmmsUUU in Get-ComputerRestorePoint hence it had to be converted using [System.Management.ManagementDateTimeConverter]::ToDateTime.
I used a TimeSpan object to subtract time: $ConvertedTime - $actualTime.

In regards to deleting the oldest restore points there seems to be no command for it in PowerShell. Instead I googled and found out a cmd command 
vssadmin can be used.
In my case I used vssadmin Delete Shadows /For=C: /Oldest /Quiet to delete the oldest restore point without having to confirm the action.

   A Function that creates restore point and delete the oldest one if there are 2 or more exisiting checkpoints.
