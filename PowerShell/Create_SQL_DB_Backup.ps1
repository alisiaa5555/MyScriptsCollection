I wrote this script in order to automate creation of my Expenses database backups.
The script contains function that creates full backup of my DB.
First, the script checks if there are any backups created. If variable $bakLastWrite is null, function Create_DB_Backup is called and new backup is created.
Else, the script calculates the time difference using NEW-TIMESPAN cmdlet and if the difference is greater than or equal to 5, function Create_DB_Backup is called and new backup is created. Else, the script ends with information that last backup was created less than 5 ago. 
The output is logged to the path.
